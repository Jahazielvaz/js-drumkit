REQUIREMENTS
-Have some kind of rockstar background.
-Have 9 keys
-Have the keys make a different drum sound as the user hovers (It's supposed to be when the user clicks, but I think hover will be more useful)
-Have the keys animate, and get bigger, as well as getting a temporary border

USEFUL CODE TO EXPLORE
-data-attribute: This allows you to make up your own attribute, that you can use as long as you include the data-.
-dynamically adding classes to an element.
-Transform scale
-<kbd> tag. This is used for user keyboard input. It sounds like it could be a really cool tag to explore.
